# Tools for fMRI analysis. Welcome!
![alt text](https://i.imgbox.com/QqCVWa0v.png "Title")

This is a python module for performing fMRI analysis with the Nipype framework. 

## Analysis tools: Setting up your system.

In order to use the analysis tools, you will first need to prepare a system. For neuroimaging analysis, it is highly recommended that you use a UNIX based operating system (Mac, Linux), since popular software packages such as FSL and Freesurfer do not work on windows. Indeed, this module mostly relies on FSL commands. Therefore, there are 2 options available to you, which I now list on order of preference.

### 1) Download the fMRI Virtual Machine

I have prepared a virtual linux machine that will operate on a windows or Mac OS. It's specifications and installation instructions are provided [here](/Hardware). This system is prepared with an ANACONDA environment with all the required python modules, including MRITOOLS itself.  

### 2) Use the linux machine in the PG hub.

UOS-210028 is equipped with memory specifications that will exceed your own personal computer. This system (Linux Redhat Enterprise) is prepared with an ANACONDA environment with all the required python modules, including MRITOOLS itself.

## Python scripts
