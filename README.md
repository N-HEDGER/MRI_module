# Tools for fMRI analysis

This is a python module for performing fMRI analysis with the Nipype framework. 

# Analysis tools: Setting up your system.

In order to use the analysis tools, you will first need to prepare a system. For neuroimaging analysis, it is highly recommended that you use a UNIX based operating system (Mac, Linux), since popular software packages such as FSL and Freesurfer do not work on windows. Indeed, this module mostly relies on FSL commands. Therefore, there are 3 options available to you, which I now list on order of preference.

## 1) Use one of the linux machines in the PG hub.

These systems are already prepared and they are equipped with memory specifications that will exceed your own personal computer. Specifications are listed [here] (/Hardware)

## 2) Download the fMRI Virtual Machine

I have prepared a virtual linux machine that will operate on a windows or Mac OS. It's specifications and installation instructions are provided [here] (/Hardware):  


## 3) Prepare your own system

This is a relatively involved process and you may want to set aside several hours. I have provided instructions on how to prepare your own (Mac or Linux) system here:
